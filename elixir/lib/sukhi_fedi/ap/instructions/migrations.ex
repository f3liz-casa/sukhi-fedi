  Inbound account migration: a `Move` activity from an `old` identity to
  a `new` one (Mastodon-standard account migration).

  When `old` (an account a local user follows) announces it has moved to
  `new`, we re-point each local follow `old → new`: follow the new
  identity and `Undo` the follow of the old one. Both rides ride the
  transactional outbox so the outbound `Follow` / `Undo(Follow)` are
  durable (CODE_STYLE §4).

  ## Consent

  A `Move` is signed by `old`, so it can only prove that *old* wants to
  leave — never that *new* agreed to receive `old`'s followers. The
  bidirectional consent both Mastodon and we require is that the **new**
  actor lists `old` in its `alsoKnownAs`. We fetch the new actor fresh
  (the Move's payload is not authority for what `new` claims) and check
  its mirrored `aliases`. The check is one pure predicate,
  `bidirectional_consent?/2`, in the style of
  `Instructions.trusted_inline_origin?/2` — never inlined at a call site
  (CODE_STYLE §3).
