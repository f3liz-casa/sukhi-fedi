defmodule SukhiFedi.Web.QuoteAuthorizationController do
  @moduledoc """
  Serves a FEP-044f `QuoteAuthorization` as AP JSON-LD.

  When a remote actor quotes one of our notes we grant a stamp
  (`AP.Instructions.Quotes`) and reply with an `Accept` whose `result`
  points here. The quoter embeds this URL as `quoteAuthorization`; their
  followers' servers dereference it to verify the quote was approved —
  authenticity comes from it being served under our own domain.

  `attributedTo` (the quoted note's author) and `interactionTarget` (the
  note's AP id) are derived from the stored `note_id`, never trusted from
  the request.
