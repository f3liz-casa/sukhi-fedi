defmodule SukhiFedi.Maintenance.WipeRemote do
  @moduledoc """
  Wipe mirrored remote-origin notes so they can be rebuilt from scratch —
  the "external data is a reconstructible cache" half of keeping external
  and internal data separate. Use it when a peer fed us bad note data and
  the cleanest fix is to drop the mirror and re-mirror it.

  Scope is strictly remote notes (`ap_id IS NOT NULL`, via
  `SukhiFedi.Notes.remote_notes/1`). A local note carries no `ap_id`, so
  this can never touch one. Pass `domain: "peer.example"` to reset just one
  server's notes instead of every remote note.

  Deleting a note cascades to its dependent rows through the existing
  foreign keys — boosts, bookmarks, reactions, pinned, note_tags,
  note_media, notifications and poll rows are `on_delete: :delete_all`;
  `reports.note_id` is `:nilify_all`. **Accounts and follow edges are not
  touched**, so local follow relationships survive the wipe. Remote actor
  shadows are corrected separately with `RefetchActors` (in-place update),
  not here — they're protected by a `RESTRICT` on `follows.followee_id`
  anyway.

  Two honest caveats, both surfaced by `run(:dry_run)`:

    * A *local* user's reaction / boost / bookmark of a remote note
      references that note, so it cascades away with it. After a rebuild the
      note returns under a fresh id, so such a local interaction couldn't
      have been carried across regardless. Accepted for a personal instance.
    * Rebuild only restores notes the archive (or the origin) still has. A
      remote note that was never archived to `inbound` and whose origin is
      now gone would not come back. So this is a reset of the *cache*, not a
      lossless round-trip — read the dry-run before executing.

  Run on the live gateway, dry-run first, then rebuild:

      bin/sukhi_fedi rpc 'SukhiFedi.Maintenance.WipeRemote.run(:dry_run)'
      bin/sukhi_fedi rpc 'SukhiFedi.Maintenance.WipeRemote.run(:execute)'
      bin/sukhi_fedi rpc 'SukhiFedi.Maintenance.RebuildFromArchive.run(:execute)'

  Scope to one peer:
