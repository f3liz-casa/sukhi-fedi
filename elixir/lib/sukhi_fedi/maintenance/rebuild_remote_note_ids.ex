defmodule SukhiFedi.Maintenance.RebuildRemoteNoteIds do
  @moduledoc """
  One-off: re-mint a remote note's snowflake `id` from its `created_at`,
  so id-ordered timelines sort by *when it was authored*, not when we
  happened to receive it.

  A snowflake `id` is `((ms_since_2024) << 16) | seq`, minted by the DB
  default `snowflake_id()` at **insert time**. `created_at`, since v0.2.2,
  carries the origin `published`. For a live post the two are within
  seconds, so they agree. But a back-filled thread or a delayed delivery
  is inserted *now* while it was published hours or days ago — it gets a
  fresh id and jumps to the top of the timeline, showing an old date in a
  new position. Timelines order by `desc: id` (`SukhiFedi.Timelines`), so
  the displayed time and the slot disagree.

  This re-mints the id from `created_at` (second precision, matching
  `snowflake_id()`'s epoch and layout), so id-order == created_at-order.
  It does **not** touch `created_at` itself — that must already be the
  true `published`. The raw inbound bytes in rustfs are the system of
  record for that; run `RebuildFromArchive` first if any note still shows
  a fetch-time date, then run this to align the id to it.

  Because the id is the primary key, every row that points at the old id
  must move with it. We read the FK list from the catalog
  (`note_fk_refs/0`) so a table added later can't be silently missed and
  have its reactions/boosts cascade-deleted. Per note, in one
  transaction:

    1. insert a copy with the new id (`ap_id` left NULL so the unique
       index doesn't collide with the row we're replacing), every other
       field carried verbatim;
    2. repoint each FK ref from the old id to the new id;
    3. delete the old row (now unreferenced — nothing cascades);
    4. move the real `ap_id` onto the new row.

  Idempotent: a note whose id already encodes its `created_at` (within
  `skew_s`) is skipped, so a second run is a no-op. Local notes (no
  `ap_id`) are never touched — their id and created_at are minted
  together at post time and already agree.
