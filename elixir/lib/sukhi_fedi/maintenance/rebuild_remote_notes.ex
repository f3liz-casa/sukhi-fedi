defmodule SukhiFedi.Maintenance.RebuildRemoteNotes do
  @moduledoc """
  One-off: rebuild remote notes that still carry a pre-snowflake,
  sequential `id`.

  Those rows predate the snowflake-id migration, so they sort as ancient
  in id-ordered timelines, and (until v0.2.2) their `created_at` was the
  fetch time rather than the origin `published`. This re-fetches each
  one, mints a fresh snowflake id, and stamps `created_at` from the
  remote `published`.

  Because the id is the primary key, every row that points at the old id
  must move with it. We don't hardcode that list — we read it from the
  catalog (`note_fk_refs/0`), so a table added later can't be silently
  missed and have its reactions/boosts cascade-deleted.

  Per note, in one transaction:

    1. insert a new row (snowflake id, `ap_id` left NULL for now so the
       unique index doesn't collide with the row we're replacing),
       keeping every stored field and setting `created_at` from the
       re-fetched `published`;
    2. repoint each FK ref from the old id to the new id;
    3. delete the old row (now unreferenced — nothing cascades);
    4. move the real `ap_id` onto the new row.

  Fetch-first: a note whose origin is gone or unreachable is left exactly
  as-is, never deleted. Reply threading survives because it keys on
  `ap_id` (preserved), not the numeric id. Idempotent: a second run finds
  no sequential ids left.

  Run on the gateway (it owns the Repo and the federation fetch path):
