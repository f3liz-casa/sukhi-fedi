# Extra args are passed straight to `mix test`.

# What this DOES cover: every test that only needs Postgres. PGlite
# replaces the docker-compose Postgres entirely.
#
# What it does NOT: tests that need NATS (streaming) or S3 (media,
# inbound_archive). The streaming addon is disabled here so the app can
# boot without NATS; for those tests bring up docker-compose.test.yml.
#
# Caveats baked in: PGlite serves a single database multiplexed over one
# connection, so the Repo runs with a small pool and the migration lock
# is off (config/test.exs reads DB_* env). See docs/TESTING.md.
